# Movie Recommendation System

This Python script implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: MovieLens dataset
- **Data Source**: [upload on git]
- The dataset contains the following attributes:
  - index
  -budget
  - genres
  - homepage
  - id
  - keywords
  - original_language
  - original_title
  - overview
  - popularity
  - production_companies
  - release_date
  - runtime
  - revenue
  - spoken_languages
  - status
  - tagline
  - title
  - vote_average
  - vote_count
  - cast
  - crew
  - director

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **recommendation_system.py**: Python script for movie recommendations.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-recommendation-system
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
## Evaluation
The script provides a list of recommended movies for a given user. Evaluation metrics may include precision, recall, and mean squared error.

## Results
The recommendation system suggests movies based on the input user ID. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the recommendation system:

-Explore other recommendation algorithms such as content-based filtering.

-Incorporate user feedback for real-time updates to recommendations.

-Consider hybrid approaches combining collaborative and content-based methods.
